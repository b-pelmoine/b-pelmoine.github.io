I've been working on Magicats builder for the duration of my 6 month intership at Dreamz Studio for the second year of Master degree at [ENJMIN](https://enjmin.cnam.fr/enjmin/ecole-nationale-du-jeu-et-des-medias-interactifs-accueil-1126103.kjsp)

The game has been released on [steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/788440/MagiCats_Builder__Infinite_Pack/) but the servers have closed meaning the game is no longer playable
