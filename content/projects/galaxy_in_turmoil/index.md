> Galaxy in Turmoil is a FREE multiplayer combined-arms game set in a brand-new universe, created by a team of volunteers with a single vision: Create a franchise that is community-focused, without the need for Pay-to-Win or Gambling. It’s all about endless arms races, corporate espionage, and, most of all, blasting up on the enemy faction and taking their stuff. In its final incarnation, the game will feature up to 64-player battles across a range of planets, space stations, and remote outposts, covering an assortment of team-v-team combat situations.

> Galaxy in Turmoil features flexible scenarios where you, the player, decide how best to complete your mission. Need to take down a shield generator to advance your team’s objective? Sneak in on foot and plant some remote explosives or hop in a starfighter and carry out bombing runs. If you’re so inclined, you can even grab a tank and storm right into the enemy base. Want to disable that pesky capital ship that’s scraping the upper atmosphere? Strap into a pilot seat and soar up through the clouds. The choice is yours!
